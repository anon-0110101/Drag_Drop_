# Drag_Drop 

This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating the creation of a drag and drop area for elements. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the implementation of a user-friendly interface where users can move blocks from one side to another and back, exploring the versatility of drag and drop functionality.

Project Overview
HTML: The HTML structure defines the layout of the web page, including the drag and drop area, the blocks to be moved, and other supporting elements.

CSS: CSS styles are employed to enhance the visual design, creating an attractive and responsive interface for smooth interaction.

JavaScript: JavaScript code is responsible for handling the drag and drop functionality, enabling users to move blocks across the page with ease.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
On the web page, you will see draggable blocks on one side and a designated drop area on the other side.
